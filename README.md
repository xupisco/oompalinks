##Veja bem... importante!

Você precisa ter o arquivo **settings_local.py** no root da aplicação, com as suas configurações. Abaixo um exmplo:

    # -*- coding: utf-8 -*

    DEBUG = True
    TEMPLATE_DEBUG = DEBUG

    DATABASE_ENGINE = 'sqlite3'
    DATABASE_NAME = '/path/completo/para/o/banco.db'
    DATABASE_USER = ''
    DATABASE_PASSWORD = ''
    DATABASE_HOST = ''
    DATABASE_PORT = ''

    CURRENT_SERVER = "127.0.0.1:8000"
    

##It's something like this...

Oompa Loompa doompadee doo  
I've got another puzzle for you  
Oompa Loompa doompadah dee  
If you are wise you'll listen to me

What do you get from a glut of TV?  
A pain in the neck and an IQ of three  
Why don't you try simply reading a book?  
Or could you just not bear to look?

You'll get no  
You'll get no  
You'll get no  
You'll get no  
You'll get no commercials

Oompa Loompa Doompadee Dah  
If you're not greedy you will go far  
You will live in happiness too  
Like the Oompa  
Oompa Loompa doompadee do
